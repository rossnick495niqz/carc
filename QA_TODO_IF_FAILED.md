# QA Remediation Plan
*Generated: 2025-12-22T23:36:00+03:00*

**Status:** ALL CHECKS PASSED.

## Verified Items
- [x] Build and Tests are green.
- [x] Dist folder contains all PWA and Data assets.
- [x] No unsafe absolute paths detected.
- [x] Live endpoints are reachable (200 OK).
- [x] PRO/PDF code signatures are present.

## Non-Critical Findings
- **PWA Icons**: The PWA build is using `icon.svg`. While modern and supported, check if target stores require static PNGs (`pwa-192x192.png`). If so, they are currently auto-generated by VitePWA but not checked in to source control (generated in `dist/assets` or `dist/` at build time). `ls -la dist` only showed `icon.svg` at root; if needed, configure `vite-plugin-pwa` to explicitly ensure PNG output or copy them.
